This is a Social Media Site App, with backend approach specifically which is developed using Nodejs as runtime environment for backend code, Expressjs as server, and MongoDB as databse.
Here, I had created my own backend API's, which can perform CRUD operation very well.
This project consists of 4-major models - User, Post, Follow and Profile; along with controllers and routes folder
For Authentication, I tried to use JWT token.
Also, I tried my best to test each and every API's with all possible test cases and finally developed an error-free environment.
